# TRAMITTER AND RECIEVER FOR MICROCONTROLLERS
# 1.	Introduction:
                       
 Communication between multiple controllers is almost a must when it comes to large projectS. So, in this Lab we’ll investigate in brief the use of the atmega328, PIC16F877a and the Arduino Uno in some communication scenarios. Also come across a few widely used communication protocols such as I2C, SPI.
  
  

# 2.	Objectives

    • Explore the communication between multiple microcontrollers.
    • Use Visual Studio Code.
    • Using SIMULIDE,Proteus as a simulator for such a communication.
    • Use the Serial communication.
