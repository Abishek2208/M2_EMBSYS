# UART USING ATMEGA MICROCONTROLLER
# 1.	Introduction:
                       
 Communication between multiple controllers is almost a must when it comes to large projects. So, in this we’ll investigate in brief the use of the atmega328, PIC16F877a and the Arduino Uno in some communication scenarios. Also come across a few widely used communication protocols such as I2C, SPI. The Universal Asynchronous Receiver and Transmitter (UART) capability of the Atmega328P allows you to easily comminicate with your microcontroller from your PC. In addition, it is the primary interface to many other devices, such as GPS receivers. Here we will look at some basic functions that will allow you to utilize UART in your microcontroller project.
  
  
# 2.	Objectives

    • Explore the communication between multiple microcontrollers.
    • Use Visual Studio Code.
    • Using SIMULIDE,Proteus as a simulator for such a communication.
    • Use the Serial communication.
    
# SWOT ANALYSIS

## Strength
Model based:As precise as the designer wants it to be.
Data driven:Requires less or no domain knowledge.

## Weakness
Model based:Requires detailed domain knowledge.
            Time consuming.
Data driven: Immense data required
    
## Opportunities
Model based: Can be extrapolated with available data .
Data driven:Quicker process.
            Less modeling skill.
## Threats
Model based:Modeling errors
            Under modeling
Data driven:Outputs can be imprecise
            Misinterpretations        

# 5W'S AND 1H
## What :
Communication between multiple controllers is almost a must when it comes to large projects
## Why :
because the configurability of both the data format and the speeds at which it is transmitted/received
## When :
The main purpose of a transmitter and receiver line for each device is to transmit and receive serial data intended for serial communication.
## Where:
UART is one of the most simple and most commonly used Serial Communication techniques.
## Who:
Embedded systems, microcontrollers, and computers mostly use UART as a form of device-to-device hardware communication protocol
## How:
Using software like visual studio code and simulIDE in c programming.
