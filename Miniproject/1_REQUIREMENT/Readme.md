# UART USING MICROCONTROLLERS
# 1.	Introduction:
                       
 Communication between multiple controllers is almost a must when it comes to large projectS. So, in this Lab we’ll investigate in brief the use of the atmega328, PIC16F877a and the Arduino Uno in some communication scenarios. Also come across a few widely used communication protocols such as I2C, SPI. The Universal Asynchronous Receiver and Transmitter (UART) capability of the Atmega328P allows you to easily comminicate with your microcontroller from your PC. In addition, it is the primary interface to many other devices, such as GPS receivers. Here we will look at some basic functions that will allow you to utilize UART in your microcontroller project.
  
  
# 2.	Objectives

    • Explore the communication between multiple microcontrollers.
    • Use Visual Studio Code.
    • Using SIMULIDE,Proteus as a simulator for such a communication.
    • Use the Serial communication.
