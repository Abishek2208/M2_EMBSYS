# MICROWAVE OVEN
## INTRODUCTION
A microwave oven (commonly called a microwave) is a machine that cooks food using microwaves, a type of radio wave. 
A microwave oven (commonly referred to as a microwave) is an electric oven that heats and cooks food by exposing it to 
electromagnetic radiation in the microwave frequency range. This induces polar molecules in the food to rotate and produce 
thermal energy in a process known as dielectric heating.

## REQUIREMENT
      Arduino micro-controller
      Bluetooth
      Display
      Battery wires, soldering iron, a switch and 10K ohm resistance(for a button), and a batter jack. 
      Preparing for Android

## LCD Display
Displays the amount of time we set for cooking and different modes of cooking.
## Buttons/Touch Screen
Helps us in selecting time and mode of cooking.
## Safety Sensor
This Safety lock sensor gives data to Micro Controller whether door is open or close while cooking.
## Actuator (Safety Lock)
Stops the oven if door is open while cooking
## Motor Driver
Used to drive the motor (Actuator)
## Actuator (Motor)
Rotates the food while cooking with the help of base plate so that food is cooked uniformly.
## REAL TIME Clock
This is used to synchronize the Micro controller with other activities.
## Sensor (Heat Detector)
This sensor gives temperature values to Micro controller and then the HVAC control unit is worked accordingly.
## ROM
This is a memory module which store Data memory and Program memory respectively
## Relays and voltage Control Unit
This system consists of relays and transformer which are controlled by the micro controller.
## Magnetron
This is activated according to the user selected input with the help of microcontroller.
## Temperature Sensor
Cuts off the power supply by switching off if temperature exceeds certain limit.
## HVAC Control unit
Heats and cools the system according to the temperature with the help of microcontroller
## MicroController
Performs all the important operations and helps our oven to work correctly without any damages by controlling all the inputs and outputs accordingly.

## APPLICATION
Because of their speed and convenience, microwave ovens have become an indispensable part of modern kitchens. Many developments in the microwave market and allied industries are taking place fairly rapidly. For example, foods and utensils designed specially for microwave cooking have become a huge business. New features will also be introduced in microwaves themselves, including computerized storage of recipes that the consumer will be able to recall at the touch of a button. The display and programmability of the ovens will also be improved, and combination ovens capable of cooking with microwaves as well as by conventional methods will become a standard household product.
