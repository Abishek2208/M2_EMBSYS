## FEATURES:
         Arduino board is a micro-processor and a storage, and there’s only one input method : a button. Bluetooth is to communicate with other devices, and the battery would be necessary for power. I’ll install an Android app for collecting or editing various RSS and system information and for notification on the Android device.

## REQUIREMENT:Hardware parts for smart watch
          Arduino micro-controller
          Bluetooth
          Display
          Battery wires, soldering iron, a switch and 10K ohm resistance(for a button), and a batter jack. It would be helpful for you to prepare the assembly manual.
          Preparing for Android
